	<h1>Overwhelmed from self doubt</h1>
	<p>Since i did not have my own personal computer i thought i wouldnt be able to do any homework,i went to the school library and the computers in their didnt have any of the programs i needed for the class. So i thought about buying my own computer and just buying the program but im living on limited resources at the momment. So i started doubting my ability to suceed in the class,this is also my first year so i was really feeling kinda lost at the beginning. but then i was told there was a computer lab down stairs in the fitermen building the whole which made me feel kinda dumb for worrying and slacking so much.</p>
<h2>creating the image</h2>
<p>Well for some reason i always like draons, maybe because their so powerful or i think i want to fly but i wouldnt want to be a dragon. I would rather tame one and ride it or something if they were real but anyways i chose to create a dragon. At first i used the painting tool to create the dragons shape, once i did that i also use the painting tool to add more details to the dragon.After i finished with that i had to create the background which was kinda diffcult to me since i drew the dragon first the background and its colors started to overlap the dragon so i had to redraw the dragon over in certain areas.After that was the hardest process of all to me, i had to color in the background and dragon very slowly since i made it free form and the shapes wasnt connected. So i had to take my time with the paint brush until i got the brightest idea, i started adding random shapes to the background and coloring them in which speeded up my process alot but that cause different colors to overlap the dragon again so i had to redo it like five times with the painting tool.</p>
