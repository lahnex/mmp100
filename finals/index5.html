      	<h1>How did tigers get endangered</h1>
  <p>How did the tiger get endangered? The primary threats to the survival of Siberian tigers are poaching and habitat loss from humans and human development.The Siberian Tiger is classified as endangered by the IUCN.South China tigers are the smallest of all the tiger subspecies,it is also the most critically endangered.Habitat loss is only one of several significant threats to the endangered tiger’s survival. As long as the demand and market for tiger parts in traditional Chinese medicine thrive, lives of tigers will be threatened.Tigers have lost 93% of their historical range. Their habitat has been destroyed, degraded and fragmented by human activities. The clearing of forests for agriculture and timber, as well as the building of road networks and other development activities, pose serious threats to tiger habitats. Tigers need wide swaths of habitat for their survival since they are very territorial. Fewer tigers can survive in small, scattered islands of habitat, which leads to a higher risk of inbreeding and makes tigers more vulnerable to poaching as they venture beyond protected areas to establish their own territories.</p>

<h3>fun tiger facts</h3>
<p>When tigers roar, the sound can be heard nearly two miles away. Why are a tiger’s pipes so powerful? It turns out they can stretch their vocal cords in a special way that pumps up the volume of their vocalizations.No two tigers have the same stripe pattern on their coats. So the animals’ fur is sort of like a human fingerprint.Tigers can eat more than 80 pounds of meat in one meal, that’s like eating 70 T-bone steaks! Their favorite snacks are deer, water buffalo, and antelope.Tigers and domestic cats might not look that much alike, but they share some behaviors.Unlike most felines, many tigers enjoy swimming. They take dips in rivers to cool off when it’s hot. These water cats have been known to paddle five miles through bodies of water.
