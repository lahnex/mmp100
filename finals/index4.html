<h3>fun leopards facts</h3>
<p>The cat has strong, short front limbs and longer hind limbs. They help launch the cat up to 30 feet in one leap.The leopard's climbing ability sets it apart from the other big cats and has made it the most successful of the group as far as its numbers in the wild.Their tree climbing prowess doesn't just give them the means to keep their kills safe, it also provides them a quick escape from the many animals on the African plains that can make life tough.From a distance, Black panthers appear to be solid black in color, but close up you can actually see black spots on the coat.</p>
